# project-beta-automations

This repository provides the ability to automate GitHub issues and pull requests for [Github Projects (Beta)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects). To do this, it automates the **Status** and user-defined fields to put issues and pull requests into the desired status, and therefore the desired column in the Board view. If the issue or pull request does not already exist in the project, it will be added.

Note: GITHUB_TOKEN does not have the necessary scopes to access projects (beta).
You must create a token with ***org:write*** scope and save it as a secret in your repository or organization.
For more information, see [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## Project board

Since the issues and pull requests from this repository are also managed by this automation, you can take an example from the public project board to see what it looks like.

[Project board](https://github.com/users/leonsteinhaeuser/projects/6).

## Variables

| Variable           | Required | Description |
| ------------------ | -------- |----------- |
| `gh_token`         | true     | The GitHub token to use for the automation. |
| `user`             | false    | The GitHub username that owns the projectboard. Either a user or an organization must be specified. |
| `organization`     | false    | The GitHub organization that owns the projectboard. Either a user or an organization must be specified. |
| `project_id`       | true     | The projectboard id. |
| `resource_node_id` | true     | The id of the resource node. |
| `status_value`     | false    | The status value to set. Must be one of the values defined in your project board **Status field settings**. If left unspecified, new items are added without an explicit status, and existing items are left alone. |
| `operation_mode`   | false     | The operation mode to use. Must be one of `custom_field`, `status`. Defaults to: `status` |
| `custom_field_values` | false | Provides the possibility to change custom fields. To be applied the **operation_mode** must be set to `custom_field`. For the json definition refer to [JSON-Definition](#JSON-Definition) |

## Getting started

The following example assumes that you have a project board with the following columns:

- **Todo**
- **In Progress**
- **Done**

Before we start to automate the project board, we need to decide whether we want to manage the **Status** field using this action or the workflow definition of the project board. Keep in mind that until now there is no way to automatically add issues or pull requests to the project board using the provided workflow functionality by GitHub. The next example assumes that you decided to use this action to manage the **Status** field.

| Current Status | Target Status   | Event name  | GitHub event  | Description |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----- | ------------- | ----------- |
| **any**        | **Todo**        | issues | `github.event.action == 'opened'`, `github.event.action == 'reopened'` | Define an automation that moves an issue to the *Todo* column. |
| **any**        | **In Progress** | pull_request    | `github.event.action == 'opened'`, `github.event.action == 'reopened'`, `github.event.action == 'review_requested'` | Define an automation that moves a pull request to the *In Progress* column. |
| **any**        | **Closed**      | issues, pull_request | `github.event.action == 'closed'` | Define an automation that moves an issue or pull request to the *Done* column. |

The resulting workflow file is defined as follows:

```yaml
name: Project automations
on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened
      - closed
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened
      - review_requested
      - closed

## JSON-Definition

A single json object is defined as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "Sample Text Field", # defines the name of the custom field
  "type": "text", # can be one of: text, number, date, single_select, iteration
  "value": "High" # defines the value to set (string)
}
```

The json definition that must be passed to the `custom_field_values` argument looks like:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Priority",
    "type": "single_select",
    "value": "High"
  }
  {
    "name": "Context",
    "type": "text",
    "value": "Just a random text"
  }
]
```

A detailed example can be found inside the [test.sh](test.sh) file. Note that json definition must be enclosed in an array and escaped with double quotes and backslashes.

Example:

```yaml
'[{\"name\": \"Priority\",\"type\": \"text\",\"value\": \"uuid1\"},{\"name\": \"Number\",\"type\": \"number\",\"value\": \"100\"},{\"name\": \"Date\",\"type\": \"date\",\"value\": \"2022-01-28T20:02:27.306+01:00\"},{\"name\": \"Single Select\",\"type\": \"single_select\",\"value\": \"Option 1\"},{\"name\": \"Iteration\",\"type\": \"iteration\",\"value\": \"Iteration 1\"}]'
```

The following example assumes that your project has the following fields defined:

- `Priority`: As *text* field
- `Number`: As *number* field
- `Date`: As *date* field
- `Single Select`: As *single_select* field with options:
  - `Option 1`
  - `Option 2`
  - `Option 3`
- `Iteration`: As *iteration* field with iterations:
  - `Iteration 1`
  - `Iteration 2`
  - `Iteration 3`

```yaml
name: Project automations (organization)

on:
  issues:
  pull_request:

env:
  gh_project_token: ${{ secrets.PAC_TOKEN }}
  project_id: 1
  gh_organization: sample-org
  status_todo: "Todo"
  status_in_progress: "In Progress"
  custom_field_values: '[{\"name\": \"Priority\",\"type\": \"text\",\"value\": \"uuid1\"},{\"name\": \"Number\",\"type\": \"number\",\"value\": \"100\"},{\"name\": \"Date\",\"type\": \"date\",\"value\": \"2022-01-28T20:02:27.306+01:00\"},{\"name\": \"Single Select\",\"type\": \"single_select\",\"value\": \"Option 1\"},{\"name\": \"Iteration\",\"type\": \"iteration\",\"value\": \"Iteration 1\"}]'

## Detailed example

Since this repository is also covered by this automation, you can take a look at the definition within the [project-automation.yml](.github/workflows/project_automations.yml) file to check how it is defined here.

## Debugging

Since debugging is key when tracing a bug, we decided to provide a two step debugging process. To enable the different debugging outputs, you can set the following environment variables:

| Variable         | Option | Default behaviour | Description |
| ---------------- | -------| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEBUG_COMMANDS` | `true` | Do nothing        | Enables the stacktrace for command executions.     |
| `DEBUG_LOG`      | `true` | Do nothing        | Prints out the responses produced by the commands. |

Example workflow definition:

```yaml
env:
  todo: Todo ‚úèÔ∏è
  gh_project_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
  user: sample-user
  project_id: 1

jobs:
  issue_opened:
    name: issue_opened
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'issues' && github.event.action == 'opened'
    steps:
      - name: Move issue to ${{ env.todo }}
        uses: leonsteinhaeuser/project-beta-automations@v1.1.0-alpha.1
        env:
          DEBUG_COMMANDS: true
          DEBUG_LOG: true
        with:
          gh_token: ${{ env.gh_project_token }}
          user: ${{ env.user }}
          # organization: sample-org
          project_id: ${{ env.project_id }}
          resource_node_id: ${{ github.event.issue.node_id }}
          status_value: ${{ env.todo }}
```
